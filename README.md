This repository is a clearing house for resources for individual workshops from [City Colleges of Chicago School of Continuing Education](https://www.ccc.edu/kennedy/departments/continuing-education/). 


# Software

For workshops, it's best to [Visual Studio, Github Desktop](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/, https://desktop.github.com/download/) on your own laptop (free).  If you can't install these programs or run into issues installing packages, [Posit Cloud ](https://posit.cloud/)is a good option.


# Learning More

**See our guide to free, [online resources for Github actions ](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/about-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) and a easy to follow [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URmeTqglS58) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEy4eLdhFs).

## Other Statistical Programs

If you're coming to R from Stata, SPSS, SAS, Matlab, or Python, the following resources might be useful to you. Some of them may be a little outdated, but each contains some tables of equivalent commands across programs that might help you get familiar with R more quickly.

[R/Stata Comparison](http://www.princeton.edu/~otorres/RStata.pdf) from Princeton's Data & Statistical Services

[R for SAS and SPSS Users](https://r4stats.com/books/free-version/) is a book by Bob Muenchen of <a href="https://www.r4stats.com">r4stats.com</a>

[The Tidynomicon: R for Python Programmers](https://third-bit.com/tidynomicon/) by Greg Wilson; may be helpful for those coming to R from other C-derived programming languages as well.
