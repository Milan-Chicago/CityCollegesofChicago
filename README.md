Meeting ID: 996 3497 6749

Passcode: 478479

This repository is a clearing house for resources for individual workshops from [City Colleges of Chicago School of Continuing Education](https://www.ccc.edu/kennedy/departments/continuing-education/). 


# Software

For workshops, it's best to [Visual Studio, Github Desktop](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/, https://desktop.github.com/download/) on your own laptop (free).  If you can't install these programs or run into issues installing packages, [Posit Cloud ](https://posit.cloud/)is a good option.


# Learning More

**See our guide to free, [online resources for Github actions ](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/about-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) and a easy to follow [video here[(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URmeTqglS58) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEy4eLdhFs).

Resources for specific topics and R are below.


## Git

[Github Quickstart for Scientists](https://rawgit.com/nazrug/Quickstart/master/GithubQuickstart.html): aims just at teaching the workflow that many scientists use

## Other Statistical Programs

If you're coming to R from Stata, SPSS, SAS, Matlab, or Python, the following resources might be useful to you. Some of them may be a little outdated, but each contains some tables of equivalent commands across programs that might help you get familiar with R more quickly.

[R/Stata Comparison](http://www.princeton.edu/~otorres/RStata.pdf) from Princeton's Data & Statistical Services

[R for SAS and SPSS Users](https://r4stats.com/books/free-version/) is a book by Bob Muenchen of <a href="https://www.r4stats.com">r4stats.com</a>

[The Tidynomicon: R for Python Programmers](https://third-bit.com/tidynomicon/) by Greg Wilson; may be helpful for those coming to R from other C-derived programming languages as well.

[Matlab/R Reference](http://www.math.umaine.edu/~hiebeler/comp/matlabR.pdf): from David Hiebeler of the University of Maine.

[Matlab/NumPy (Python)/R Commands Chart](http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/matlab-python-xref.pdf): from Vidar Bronken Gundersen; this one is about 10 years old, but it mostly covers basic commands, which haven't changed

[haven Package](http://haven.tidyverse.org/): for importing Stata, SAS, and SPSS data into R.


## Statistics and Machine Learning

[UCLA's Statistics Consulting Group](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/) has a great set of tutorials showing how to conduct many types of ANOVA and regression analysis in various statistical packages, including R.  Highly recommended; check here first.

[An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](https://www.statlearning.com/): book, available online, by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani

[The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/): book, available online, by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman

[Deep Learning with R](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-r): book, by François Chollet with J. J. Allaire 

[Cookbook for R, Statistical Analysis section](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Statistical_analysis/) provides examples of many basic statistical methods.

[A Little Book of R for Bioinformatics](https://a-little-book-of-r-for-bioinformatics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) covers basic analysis topics in the field.


## Matrices and Vectorization

[Linear Algebra in R](https://www.math.uh.edu/~jmorgan/Math6397/day13/LinearAlgebraR-Handout.pdf) by Søren Højsgaard

Understanding Vectorization in R: [Vectorization in R: Why?](http://www.noamross.net/blog/2014/4/16/vectorization-in-r--why.html) by Noam Ross or 
[Let's talk about vectorization](http://alyssafrazee.com/2014/01/29/vectorization.html) by Alyssa Frazee
